## Description
This project provides a command line interface for a user to create a good README. A user can focus on creating a project rather than spending time working on the README. The project enables a user to provide a title, a description, instructions for installation and use, contributors, test instructions, an area for questions, and GitHub/e-mail contact information. This information is added to an approriate section within the README. A table of contents is provided, and when a user clicks on the links in the Table of Contents, a user is taken to the corresponding section of the README. Also, when a user chooses a license from a list of options, a badge is added to the 
top of the page, as well as a notice that explains which license the application is covered under.
